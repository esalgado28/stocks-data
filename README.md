- The stocks.bas script goes through the daily stock data and summarizes the yearly change and volume for each stock. Only does the current sheet. No bonus elements here.
- The stocks_bonus.bas script is a modification that takes care of the bonus tasks. It has two new subroutines - one to output the most extreme stocks, and another that simply loops through all the sheets and calls the other two subroutines in each.
- The screenshots show the results of running the stocks_bonus macro for each year in the multi-year data file.
